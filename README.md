# BestNeighbourhood

Demo : http://bestneighbourhood.com

Best Neighbourhood is a web app that is created to help users find the perfect neighbourhood for living depending on their preferences. At this point the app covers only Toronto and includes all neighbourhoods within the city.

This project was submited for 'Hack the North 2016' (Canada's biggest hackathon at University of Waterloo), original devpost.com page can be found [here](https://devpost.com/software/neighbrohood-xp7z01). 

## How It Works?

The app aggregates real government data (access provided by Namara.io API), generates summary based on GEO information and displays ranked list of neighbourhoods and their locations.

Users can choose weidghtings for individual datasets by adjusting sidebar sliders (based on what's most and least important to them).
